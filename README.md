Features of the Spell Search Addon

Dynamic Spell Search Functionality:
Users can search for spells using keywords, spell IDs, or other criteria.

As the user types in the search box, results are dynamically filtered and displayed in real-time, allowing for quick access to desired spells.
Search Result Highlighting:

Search results are highlighted, making it easier for users to spot their desired spell quickly.
The ability to scroll through search results provides a user-friendly experience without cluttering the screen with irrelevant information.
Tooltip Integration:

When users hover over a spell in the search results, detailed tooltips appear, providing crucial information about the spell, such as its effects, cooldown, mana cost, and spell ID.
This feature enhances the usability of the addon, as players can make informed decisions without needing to look up spells elsewhere.

How It Affects User Experience

Increased Accessibility

Players can quickly find and access the spells they need, reducing downtime spent searching through long lists of spells.

The real-time search function enhances the overall speed of gameplay, allowing for faster decision-making in critical moments.

Enhanced Gameplay Awareness: By providing tooltip information, players can better understand spell mechanics, enabling them to utilize spells more effectively in various situations (e.g., PvE, PvP).
